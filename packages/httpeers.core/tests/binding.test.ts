/**
 * The testability argument, made concrete.
 *
 * No libp2p, no transport, no JWT cryptography, no network. Every seam —
 * `getPeerId`, `usesTransportIdentity`, `getClaims`, `isRevoked` — is a
 * one-line stub. This is what the stopping rule asks for: one file, one
 * exported signature, behaviour assertable in isolation.
 *
 * The case this whole design exists for is the confused-deputy replay: a
 * hub-minted token is a bearer token, valid at every provider that trusts
 * the hub, so a malicious provider could otherwise replay a member's token
 * elsewhere. The handshake — `getPeerId`, which no caller can forge — is
 * what defeats it.
