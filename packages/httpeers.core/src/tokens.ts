/**
 * Membership tokens: minting and verification, over Biscuit (ADR-0019).
 *
 * A token is a Biscuit — an Ed25519-signed, attenuable capability token whose
 * contents are Datalog facts and checks — serialised as URL-safe base64. It
 * replaces the hand-rolled compact JWS this file used to carry. Prototype 10
 * (`apps/httpeers-protos/10-token-chain/`) is the reference; this file is that
 * chain narrowed to the seam the rest of the package already speaks
 * (`mintToken` / `verifyToken` / `MeshClaims`), not a re-derivation of it.
 *
 * THE MESH IS THE HUB'S peerId, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES VERIFICATION OFFLINE.
 * Biscuit verifies a token against a ROOT PUBLIC KEY the verifier supplies. We
 * do not fetch one and we do not carry one in the token: an Ed25519 libp2p
 * peerId inlines its own public key, so `peerIdFromString(issuer).publicKey`
 * IS the root key, recovered by local computation from the mesh id the caller
 * already knows. `mintToken` derives the same peerId from the signing key it
 * was handed, so a hub can only ever mint tokens that self-certify as its own
 * mesh. No JWKS, no directory, no network — the same property the JWS version
 * had, obtained the same way. This is why `tokens.ts` keeps its `@libp2p/*`
 * imports: they are not incidental, they are the bridge between the mesh's
 * identity scheme and Biscuit's key scheme (see `rootKeyFor` / `signingKeyFor`).
 *
 * WHAT THE TOKEN SAYS. `mintToken` writes one authority block:
 *
 *     mesh("<hubPeerId>"); subject("<sub>"); bound("<sub>");
 *     role("<r>"); ...  issued_at(<iatMs>); expires_at(<expMs>);
 *     audience("<peer>"); ...            // OR audience_unrestricted(true)
 *     check if bound($k), connection_peer($k);
 *     check if mesh($m), root_mesh($m);
 *     check if audience($k), self_peer($k);   // OR: audience_unrestricted(true)
 *     check if time_ms($t), $t < <expMs>;
 *
 * WHAT THE VERIFIER SAYS. `verifyToken` asserts, and only ever asserts, facts
 * the NODE knows — never anything read out of the token:
 *
 *     connection_peer("<what the transport handshake proved>");
 *     self_peer("<this verifier's own peerId>");
 *     root_mesh("<the mesh this verifier expects>");
 *     time_ms(<this verifier's clock>);
 *     allow if true;
 *
 * That separation is the design (prototype 10's README), not an implementation
 * detail: the token states what it was granted, the node states what is true
 * right now, and Datalog decides. `allow if true` means "this verifier adds no
 * policy of its own; the token's own checks are the whole decision" — exactly
 * the JWS-era semantics, and it stays that way. The NODE's policy is a second,
 * separate authorization in `rules.ts`, run by the policy middleware over the
 * claims this one produced: splitting them is what keeps a tokenless request
 * decidable and keeps "no usable token" a 401 while "not permitted" is a 403.
 * See `rules.ts`'s `authorize` for the full argument.
 *
 * THE BINDING IS DATALOG NOW (ADR-0009). `check if bound($k),
 * connection_peer($k)` is the rule `peer-handlers.ts` states in prose
 * (`claims.sub !== peer` -> 403). It is now enforced where it belongs — inside
 * the token, by the token — so a hub-minted bearer token cannot be replayed by
 * the provider that received it even against a verifier that forgot to check.
 * `peer-handlers.ts` keeps its own check: it is fed by an INJECTED `getClaims`
 * seam, so it must still refuse a mismatch its supplier let through.
 *
 * THE AUDIENCE, AND WHO CHECKS IT (ADR-0020). A token may name the peers it
 * may be presented to. The load-bearing detail is not the field, it is WHO
 * EVALUATES IT: `audience` is a fact of the TOKEN, `self_peer` is a fact the
 * DESTINATION asserts about itself, and the check that joins them lives in the
 * token's authority block, so it is evaluated by the receiving peer against
 * its own identity. A peer that is not an intended audience refuses however
 * the request reached it — it does not trust whoever routed it to have
 * respected the restriction. That is defence in depth behind ADR-0011's
 * forwarding decision: a bug in either is caught by the other.
 *
 * This does NOT close a replay hole — ADR-0009's binding already did that.
 * What it adds is least privilege: a token obtained to talk to one peer is
 * now mintable so that it cannot be used against another, so the blast radius
 * of a compromise stops being the whole mesh.
 *
 * The audience check needs `self_peer`, which is why `verifyToken` grew a
 * `selfPeer` option. It is OPTIONAL, and omitting it fails CLOSED: a verifier
 * that does not say who it is satisfies no `audience` fact and refuses every
 * audience-scoped token. Unrestricted tokens are unaffected, which is what
 * lets a caller that has not been updated keep working without being handed a
 * permissive default.
 *
 * UNRESTRICTED IS A STATE, NOT A SILENCE. `mintToken` always writes one of
 * two things: `audience(...)` facts plus the check above, or the explicit
 * marker `audience_unrestricted(true)` plus `check if
 * audience_unrestricted(true)` — a check that is trivially satisfied by its
 * own fact and is there so the two states are structurally parallel (a fact
 * and a check about it) rather than "present" versus "missing". A token with
 * NEITHER is possible only from an issuer older than this field; `readClaims`
 * reports that third state as `"unstated"` and it verifies as unrestricted.
 *
 * That last choice is the one migration decision here, and it is deliberate:
 * every token in flight when this shipped carries no audience, so reading
 * absence as "refuse everywhere" would break the running mesh, while reading
 * it as "valid everywhere" is exactly the permissive default ADR-0020 argues
 * against. It is safe here for a reason particular to Biscuit: the audience
 * facts and their check are in the SIGNED authority block, so an attacker
 * holding a restricted token cannot strip it back to silence — that would
 * need the hub's key. Silence is always an old issuer, never a downgrade. The
 * cost is that a mesh cannot yet REQUIRE its tokens to state an audience;
 * doing so is a verifier-side policy for whoever decides the old tokens are
 * gone, and `MeshClaims.audience` distinguishing `"unstated"` from
 * `"unrestricted"` is what makes it decidable when they do.
 *
 * NO AUDIENCE CLASSES YET. ADR-0020 also permits restriction by CLASS —
 * `audience_class($t,$v)` against a `self_fact($t,$v)` the destination
 * asserts. Not implemented: nothing in this package or the stack above it
 * produces a `self_fact`, and the ADR is explicit that such facts are
 * security-relevant and must be as trustworthy as the node's own policy. An
 * option nothing can populate would be a security surface with no source, so
 * classes wait for a node-identity configuration to attach them to. A token
 * carrying `audience_class` today is refused by A-20's rule: an unsatisfied
 * check this verifier does not know how to satisfy denies.
 *
 * AN APPENDED BLOCK CANNOT FORGE ANY OF THIS. Biscuit scopes facts: a check in
 * the authority block sees authority and authorizer facts only, never a later
 * block's. So a thief who appends `bound("mallory"); role("admin")` to a stolen
 * token changes nothing — the authority check cannot see it, and neither can
 * `readClaims`, which reads through the authorizer and therefore also sees only
 * the authority block. Attenuation can narrow a token; it can never widen one.
 * That covers the audience too: appending `audience("elsewhere")` or
 * `audience_unrestricted(true)` to a scoped token is invisible to the
 * authority check that consumes them, so it neither travels nor reports.
 *
 * MILLISECONDS, NOT DATES — the one deliberate divergence from prototype 10,
 * which asserts a date-valued `time($t)`. This package's clock is
 * `now: () => number` everywhere, and `revocation.ts` compares `claims.iat`
 * against a hub-issued `changedAt` at MILLISECOND resolution: `clock.ts`'s
 * `createMonotonicClock` exists precisely because a same-millisecond tie there
 * was a real revocation bypass. Biscuit's date terms are RFC3339 seconds, so
 * routing time through them would throw away the resolution that fix depends
 * on. The predicate is therefore named `time_ms` and carries an integer, so
 * that a rule ported from prototype 10 expecting a date fails loudly (unknown
 * predicate -> unsatisfied check -> deny, A-20) rather than silently comparing
 * two different notions of time.
