/**
 * The node's rules and policies, in Datalog (ADR-0019, spec §6.4-6.5).
 *
 * Replaces `access-tree.ts` (a walked `.access` tree) and `vocabulary.ts` (a
 * role→capability document with transitive `implies`). Those were five
 * mechanisms — a root→leaf walk, inheritance, deeper-may-widen, per-method
 * sub-entries, and a separate vocabulary — where Datalog has one, and in
 * Datalog transitivity is simply what a rule does.
 *
 * THE TOKEN CARRIES ROLES; THE NODE HOLDS THE RULES (ADR-0016 amendment).
 * The hub mints identity and role facts. This file is the other half: the
 * rules deriving capabilities from roles, and the policies governing this
 * node's own resources. Nothing remote influences a decision — a `RuleSet`
 * is constructed locally and never fetched, so there is nothing on the
 * permissive path to tamper with.
 *
 *     capability("app:notes.read")  <- role("app:reader");
 *     role("app:reader")            <- role("app:editor");   // transitive, for free
 *     allow if resource($r), $r.starts_with("/notes"), operation("GET"),
 *              capability("app:notes.read");
 *
 * FAIL FAST, NOT CLOSED — and Datalog has its own version of the mistake.
 * `withAccessTree` refused to start on a policy naming an undeclared
 * capability, because "a policy that denies everyone through a typo is
 * indistinguishable from one that is working". The Datalog form of that typo
 * is subtler and just as silent: a rule body naming a predicate NOTHING
 * asserts and NO rule derives simply never fires, and the resulting permanent
 * denial looks exactly like a working policy. `ruleSet()` therefore refuses to
 * build such a value, listing every problem rather than the first:
 *
 *   - a rule or policy that does not parse                       (was: a runtime throw)
 *   - a body predicate nothing supplies and no rule derives       (the new silent typo)
 *   - a policy naming a capability no rule can derive             (A-10, X-02)
 *   - a rule deriving a fact the node or the token asserts        (a forged input)
 *   - a policy text in `rules`, or a rule text in `policies`      (see ORDER, below)
 *
 * `time_ms`, NOT `time` — Ruling 83, inherited from `tokens.ts`. Prototype 10
 * asserts a date-valued `time($t)`; this package's clock is `() => number`
 * everywhere and `revocation.ts` orders `iat` against `changedAt` at
 * MILLISECOND resolution, which `clock.ts`'s `createMonotonicClock` exists to
 * make strict. Biscuit's date terms are RFC3339 SECONDS, so routing time
 * through them would throw away exactly the resolution that fix depends on.
 * The verifier supplies `time_ms` and never `time`, so a rule ported verbatim
 * from prototype 10 does not silently compare two different notions of time —
 * it names a predicate nothing supplies, and `ruleSet()` refuses it by name at
 * construction. That is the reconciliation: loud at build, not merely closed at
 * request time.
 *
 * ORDER: DENY FIRST. Biscuit evaluates policies in order and the first match
 * wins, so an `allow` written above a `deny` would beat it. A-05 says a `deny`
 * beats any `allow` that also matches, so `ruleSet()` emits every `deny`
 * before every `allow`, each group in the order the author wrote it. This is
 * also why a policy smuggled into `rules` is a construction error rather than
 * a curiosity: it would be added outside that ordering.
 *
 * SEGMENT BOUNDARIES ARE NOT PREFIXES. `$r.starts_with("/test")` also matches
 * `/testing`, which the tree's `/test/` key did not. The idiom that reproduces
 * "this resource AND everything under it" in one policy is an `or` variant:
 *
 *     allow if capability("std:test"), resource("/test")
 *           or capability("std:test"), resource($r), $r.starts_with("/test/");
 *
 * `DEFAULT_RULES` below is written that way, and so is every policy this
 * package's own tests rely on.
