/**
 * The transport adapter. THE ONLY FILE IN THIS PACKAGE THAT IMPORTS libp2p —
 * verify with `grep -rlE "^import.*libp2p" src/` from the package root; it
 * must list only this file. That constraint is what keeps the transport
 * swappable: everything else in `httpeers.core` talks `FetchHandler`
 * (`Request -> Promise<Response>`) and never sees a `Stream` or a
 * `Connection`.
 *
 * IDENTITY BY CLOSURE (note 24). `Duplex = (input) => AsyncGenerator` is one
 * parameter, deliberately, with no slot for identity — hiding the transport
 * is what makes `Duplex` swappable. So the serving-side `Duplex` is built PER
 * INBOUND STREAM, with the proven peer captured in that build's closure, and
 * `registerPeer` runs from inside it before `dispatch` ever sees the
 * `Request`. `serveConnections` (from `@statewalker/webrun-streams-libp2p`)
 * exists for exactly this: it calls back once per stream with a
 * `ConnectionContext` carrying `remotePeer` — the peer id libp2p's Noise
 * handshake proved for that connection, the one identity claim on the
 * serving side nothing in the request payload can forge.
 *
 * `serveConnections` is used here rather than registering the protocol by
 * hand (`node.handle`), because it already threads `ConnectionContext`
 * through and owns the serving-side input queue / backpressure handling
 * (`duplexOverStream`) a hand port would have to reimplement.

 * and the response itself — before giving up and rejecting with
 * `PeerRequestTimeoutError`. This is a CONTRACT, not a tuning knob picked in
 * isolation: no caller of this package may assume an unbounded wait for a
 * response, ever, and this is the number that bounds it by default.
 *
 * T-3 DELIBERATELY DID NOT ADD A SEPARATE QUEUE TIMEOUT. When Task 18 added

 *

 * would mean the transport gives up on a stalled response before the

 * deliberate; it is not the choice made here.
 *
 * 8 seconds: generous enough that an ordinary handler (token verification,
 * a store lookup, one hop through a relay) never trips it under normal
 * load, short enough that a caller waiting on a mesh peer notices "this
 * peer is not answering" within under two heartbeat intervals (the

 * `DEFAULT_MAX_STREAMS` states the server-side half of. Ledger note 18 §6 is
 * explicit that raising `maxInboundStreams`/`maxOutboundStreams` to 512
 * (Task 6a) MOVED the cliff rather than removing it: past the cap, libp2p
 * RESETS the stream instead of queueing it, so a caller sees a rejected
 * promise instead of latency, and nothing retries or backs off. This
 * constant bounds `createRemote`'s own concurrency instead, so a well-behaved
 * `Remote` never has to find that cliff at all: `createRemote` runs every
 * outbound call through a private, in-process semaphore of this width before
 * it ever calls `connect()` (which is what triggers libp2p's own
 * `maxOutboundStreams` check, `TooManyOutboundProtocolStreamsError` --
 * `errors.ts` row 3a). Excess calls QUEUE, in FIFO order, rather than racing
 * each other into that cap.
 *
 * DEFAULTED TO `DEFAULT_MAX_STREAMS`, NOT SOME OTHER NUMBER, DELIBERATELY:
 * this is a per-`Remote` (i.e. per-`Peer`) budget, not per-target-peer, so a
 * `Peer` that only ever calls ONE target sees IDENTICAL admitted concurrency
 * to before -- it will now queue instead of reset at the same threshold,
 * never tighter -- while a `Peer` fanning calls out to MANY targets at once
 * (a relay/hub forwarding on behalf of several callers) gets an additional,
 * new global ceiling on its own total outbound fan-out that did not exist
 * before this task. That second effect is intentional: `DEFAULT_MAX_STREAMS`
 * is a PER-CONNECTION cap, so nothing previously bounded how many
 * connections' worth of streams one `Remote` could have open at once: a
 * `Peer` calling 20 different targets at 512 streams apiece could reach
 * 10,240 concurrent outbound streams without ever touching any single
 * connection's cap. That is exactly the kind of local resource exhaustion a
 * DoS-adjacent control (see `DEFAULT_MAX_STREAMS`'s own doc comment) should
 * not leave open just because it happens to fan out across many peers
 * instead of one.
 *
 * THE AT-LIMIT CONTRACT (the decision ledger note 18 §6 left open --
 * "queue, reject fast, or apply backpressure to the caller"): QUEUE, with a
 * BOUNDED wait, then REJECT with a typed error from Task 17's taxonomy --
 * never a silent reset (that would just be `DEFAULT_MAX_STREAMS`'s cliff
 * again, moved one layer up), and never an unbounded queue (an unfailing
 * queue under sustained overload is a slow-motion version of the same
 * failure the timeout policy already rules out for every other kind of
 * hang). Concretely: the bound is `DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`, not a
 * second, independent timer. `createRemote`'s `withRequestTimeout` race
 * already covers "dial, negotiate, respond"; queueing for a `Semaphore`
 * permit is placed INSIDE that same race (before `connect()` is even
 * called), not layered outside it, specifically so a queued call that never
 * gets a permit rejects with the SAME `PeerRequestTimeoutError` an
 * unresponsive peer would produce, and within the SAME bound. The
 * alternative -- a queue timeout on top of the existing request timeout --
 * was considered and rejected: a caller that waits `requestTimeoutMs` in the
 * queue and then gets a fresh `requestTimeoutMs` for the call itself sees up
 * to 2 * `DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (16s) worst case, silently doubling a
 * contract Task 17 wrote down as an 8-second promise. Sharing one budget
 * keeps that promise: `Peer.call()` / `Remote` never wait longer than
 * `requestTimeoutMs` for ANY reason, queueing included. Whichever reason
 * wins the race, `mapPeerCallError`'s `if (err instanceof PeerCallError)
 * return err` passes it through unchanged, so this never becomes a new
 * taxonomy row -- `PeerRequestTimeoutError`'s trigger set simply grows to
 * include "gave up waiting for a local concurrency slot," alongside its
 * existing "gave up waiting for a response."
 *
 * A held permit is released in a `finally` (see `createRemote`) regardless
 * of how the call ends -- success, a mapped `PeerCallError`, or the timeout
 * race itself -- so one failing call can never permanently strand a slot.

/**
 * Build the `Remote` seam `createPeerRouter` forwards through: dial `target`
 * over libp2p and run the request over the resulting `Duplex`. Outbound is
 * definitionally identity-free — nothing here registers a peer binding,
 * because the *caller's* proven identity has no meaning on a connection *we*
 * initiated.
 *
 * Every rejection from the returned function is a `PeerCallError` (see
 * `errors.ts` and `mapPeerCallError` above) — never a raw libp2p exception,
 * and never an unbounded wait: the whole queue-dial-negotiate-respond
 * sequence (T-3/Task 18 added the queueing step) is raced against
 * `requestTimeoutMs`.
 *
 * ONE `Semaphore` PER `Remote`, NOT PER CALL: `createRemote` is called once
 * per `Peer` (see `peer.ts`'s `createPeer`), so the semaphore built here is
 * that peer's single, shared outbound admission gate for as long as the
 * `Peer` lives -- every call through this `Remote`, to every target,
 * competes for the same `maxConcurrentOutbound` permits. See
 * `DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_OUTBOUND`'s doc comment for why that scope (global
 * to this `Remote`, not per-target-peer) was chosen.
