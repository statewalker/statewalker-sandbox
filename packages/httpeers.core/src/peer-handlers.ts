/**
 * The binding middleware: asserts the token's subject is the peer the
 * transport handshake actually proved.
 *
 * A hub-minted token is a bearer token, valid at every provider that trusts
 * the hub — so without this check, a malicious provider could replay a
 * member's token against a different provider and act as that member
 * there. Binding `claims.sub` to what the transport itself proved
 * (`getPeerId`, fed by the handshake, never by anything the caller claims)
 * is what defeats that confused-deputy replay.
 *
 * Every seam is injected, so this file has no crypto, no transport and no
 * libp2p import — testable with one-line stubs. It also does no policy:
 * whether a *particular path* is permitted for a given role is
 * `rules.ts`'s job, not this one. This middleware only answers "is
 * the caller who they say they are, and is their token still good" — the
 * same class of question as the signature and expiry checks inside
 * `verifyToken`, which is why `isRevoked` lives here rather than with
 * policy.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO WHERE A REFUSED TOKEN GETS ITS STATUS. `getClaims` reports three
 * states (`ClaimsResult` in `types.ts`), and this file turns the third one —
 * "a token was presented and did not verify" — into a status code by asking
 * one question and no other: could authenticating again help? See
 * `REFUSAL_STATUS` below. The reason itself is not decided here; it is
 * `verifyToken`'s, carried through unaltered.

/**
 * WHAT SHOULD THE CLIENT DO NEXT — the only question this table answers.
 *
 * Not a taxonomy of what went wrong (that is `TokenRejectionReason` itself,
 * and it travels in the body), but the one thing a status code is actually
 * good for: whether authenticating again and retrying could possibly work.
 *
 *   401 — "authenticate and retry might work." The credential is missing or
 *         stale; a fresh one from the hub is a sensible next move.
 *   403 — "a fresh token will not help." The token is refused for something a
 *         refresh reproduces exactly: it names another mesh, another peer,
 *         another audience, or it carries a check this verifier cannot
 *         satisfy. A client that retries here loops forever.
 *
 * The audience row is the one this table was written for. Before it, ADR-0020
 * refusals answered 401, so a client scoped to peer A and calling peer B
 * refreshed, was refused identically, and refreshed again — with nothing in
 * the exchange able to say that refreshing was not the remedy.
 *
 * `malformed-token` is 401 rather than 403 deliberately: what was presented is
 * not a token at all (truncated, re-encoded, a leftover from another system),
 * so the client is in the same position as one holding no credential, and
 * obtaining a real one is exactly the remedy. `malformed-claims` is the
 * opposite case and is 403 — those bytes ARE a token this mesh signed, and it
 * says something contradictory; only the hub can fix that, not the client.
 *
 * `peer-binding` IS 401, AND THE HONEST CLIENT IS WHY. It looks like the
 * confused-deputy row — a token presented over a connection proving somebody
 * else — so it looks like the one refusal that should tell a caller to stop.
 * But an ordinary page produces this state one button-press later: every page
 * in this stack has a *reset identity* control, and a page that resets while
 * still holding a token minted for its OLD key presents exactly a token whose
 * subject does not match the key it is now proving. That is not a thief, and a
 * refresh fixes it completely — which by this table's own question makes it
 * 401.
 *
 * The asymmetry decides it rather than the taxonomy. Telling an honest client
 * to give up when a refresh would have recovered it is a real failure; a thief
 * looping on 401 costs nothing, because no amount of retrying obtains a token
 * bound to a key it does not hold. A false "stop" is worse than a harmless
 * retry. The reason still travels in the body, so the distinction stays legible
 * to anyone reading the refusal.
 *
 * `unparseable-issuer` / `issuer-not-ed25519` describe THIS peer's own
 * configured `hubPeerId`, not the presented token: they fire before any token
 * is examined, and they fire for every request. 403 is right for the reason
 * the table exists — no refresh helps — but a client cannot act on them at
 * all; they are an operator's bug reaching a caller. See the task report.
 *
 * Exhaustive by type (`Record<TokenRejectionReason, ...>`), not by a `default`
 * branch: a reason added to the union without a decision here is a compile
 * error rather than a silent fall-through to whichever status looked safe.
