/**
 * Carries a request's proven identity alongside the `Request` object
 * itself, rather than as a second function parameter.
 *
 * Why a `WeakMap` and not a field on a richer request type: the router and
 * every handler downstream of it work in plain `Request -> Response`
 * (`FetchHandler`), the same shape a transport's `fetch` handler or a
 * browser `fetch` polyfill already expects. Threading identity as an extra
 * argument would mean every handler signature in the mesh carries a
 * parameter most of them never look at. A `WeakMap` keyed on the `Request`
 * instance keeps the contract at one argument while still letting anything
 * holding that exact `Request` ask "who is this from" — and it never leaks:
 * once the `Request` is garbage-collected, so is its entry.
 *
 * The one place this needs help is a *deliberate* re-creation of the
 * `Request` (the router strips a peer prefix by constructing a new
 * `Request` with the shortened URL) — a new object has no entry of its own,
 * so `copyPeerBinding` carries the binding across that boundary by hand.
