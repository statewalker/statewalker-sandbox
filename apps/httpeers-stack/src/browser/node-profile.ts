/**
 * The browser libp2p profile.
 *
 * A browser cannot listen for inbound TCP the way `../hub/main.ts` /
 * `../relay/main.ts` do (`transport-duplex.ts`'s `createNode`, TCP-only,
 * is Node-side and stays Node-side). Instead this node reserves a relayed
 * address on the deployment's relay and accepts a WebRTC upgrade brokered
 * over it -- WebSockets to dial the relay in the first place,
 * Circuit-Relay-v2 for the reservation and for dialling other peers'
 * relayed addresses, WebRTC for the peer-to-peer upgrade once a relayed
 * connection exists. `addresses.listen: ['/p2p-circuit', '/webrtc']` and
 * this transport list are the exact configuration design note 17 §4 (the
 * relay prototype) and the validated browser-WebRTC prototype (repo notes,
 * `httpeers-plan/prototypes/21-browser-webrtc-prototype-validated/app.ts`)
 * both landed on -- not a guess assembled from the libp2p docs.
 *
 * DIALING THE RELAY AND WAITING FOR THE RESERVATION LIVE IN
 * `../reservation.ts`, re-exported below so this module still reads as the
 * one place a page asks "how do I get a browser node onto the mesh". They
 * moved there in Task 20 because they touch nothing transport-specific and
 * three callers now need them -- this file, `../hub/main.ts`, and
 * `tests/e2e/harness.ts`, the last of which had hand-copied the poll loop
 * rather than import it through this module's `@libp2p/webrtc` dependency.
 *
 * IDENTITY PERSISTS PER ORIGIN, IN INDEXEDDB -- and it lives in
 * `./identity.ts` now, re-exported below. It moved there in Task 24
 * because the hub page needs the key itself, not just a node built from
 * it: `createLibp2p` never hands a generated key back out, and the hub must
 * pass the very same key to `createPeer` so its `mintToken` closure signs
 * as the mesh. See that module for the format contract and for why
 * per-origin identities are deliberate.

/**
 * Does dialing this address need the permissive gater?
 *
 * libp2p's browser default refuses to dial loopback and private-range

 * (`localhost`/`127.0.0.1`), which asks the wrong question: what the gater
 * objects to is the address being DIALLED, not where the page came from. Open
 * the same page at `http://192.168.1.5:5177` and the hostname test says
 * "production" while `httpeers.json` still names a loopback relay -- so every
 * address in the dial is denied and the failure surfaces as
 * `DialDeniedError`, whose message blames the relay for being unreachable
 * when the relay is running perfectly well.
 *
 * Asking it of the address fixes both that case and the LAN one (a page on
 * `192.168.1.5` dialling a relay on `192.168.1.5`, also a private address,
 * also denied). A public relay address returns false and the gater stays at
 * its default, which is the behaviour a deployment wants.
