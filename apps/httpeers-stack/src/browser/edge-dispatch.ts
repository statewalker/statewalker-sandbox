/**
 * The one module that sits between a page's own `fetch()` and this peer's
 * `dispatch`. Everything a request needs in order to survive the crossing
 * page -> ServiceWorker -> `SwHttpAdapter` -> `peer.dispatch` lives here,
 * and nowhere else -- above all, NOT in the page.
 *
 * IT EXISTS SO THAT A PAGE IS AN ORDINARY HTTP CLIENT. The project's
 * central bet is that application code calls a mesh peer with a plain
 * `fetch()` -- no SDK, no client library. A page that had to hand-assemble
 * a bearer header on every call, strip a mount prefix, or parse an error
 * message string to tell "gone" from "refused" would have an SDK; it would
 * just be an undocumented one, reimplemented per page. This module is the
 * runtime's side of that bet.
 *
 * Kept dependency-free of libp2p AND of `@statewalker/webrun-http-browser`
 * on purpose (only `httpeers.core`, all of it pure): that is what lets
 * every rule below be proven under plain Node in `tests/browser-edge-
 * dispatch.test.ts` rather than deferred to Task 15's Playwright run.
 *
 * THREE JOBS, IN ORDER.
 *
 * 1. STRIP THE EDGE'S OWN MOUNT PREFIX. Verified directly against
 *    `@statewalker/webrun-http-browser@workspace:0.3.3`, not assumed:
 *    `SwHttpAdapter._handleHttpRequest` (`src/sw/http-sw-dispatcher.ts`)
 *    selects a handler by `requestUrl.indexOf(urlPrefix) === 0` and then
 *    calls `handler(request)` with the ORIGINAL, UNMODIFIED request. So a
 *    page fetching `${baseUrl}${peerId}/search` -- where `baseUrl` ends in
 *    `/${key}/`, and `key` must be the first path segment
 *    (`edge-guard.ts`'s `assertKeyMatchesPrefix`; `SwHttpDispatcher` keys
 *    its channel lookup on that segment, so mounting at `/` is not
 *    available) -- reaches `dispatch` with pathname
 *    `/${key}/${peerId}/search`. `httpeers.core`'s router
 *    (`router.ts`'s `route`) reads the FIRST segment and asks
 *    `looksLikePeerId`; `key` is not a peer id, so the request is served
 *    LOCALLY against a path no mount claims -- a 404 whose body says "not
 *    found", three layers away from the mistake. Stripping the prefix here
 *    is what makes the router see `/${peerId}/search`, which is the shape
 *    it documents.
 *
 * 2. ATTACH THE MEMBERSHIP TOKEN (Ruling 59). `peer.call()` turns a
 *    `{ token }` option into an `authorization: Bearer` header (`peer.ts`);
 *    `fetch()` has no such option, so without this every mesh call from a
 *    page would arrive at the provider tokenless and be refused 401. The
 *    token is NOT the page's to hold: it rotates on each 5 s heartbeat
 *    inside `startJoin`'s closure (`join.ts`), so a page that read one and
 *    kept it would be sending a stale token within seconds. `token()` is
 *    therefore called per request, never snapshotted.
 *
 * 3. TURN A THROWN `PeerCallError` INTO A RESPONSE (Ruling 60). `remote()`
 *    THROWS T-2's typed error; nothing between it and the page converts it
 *    to a Response, and `SwHttpDispatcher`'s own catch
 *    (`http-sw-dispatcher.ts`) collapses any thrown handler error into a
 *    bare 500 with no body. A page would then see one indistinguishable
 *    500 for a departed peer, a reset stream and a timeout -- precisely the
 *    "no way to tell 'this peer is gone' from 'this peer refused you'
 *    without parsing a message string" that `httpeers.core`'s `errors.ts`
 *    exists to end. The mapping below forwards `kind` in the body so the
 *    page can `switch` on it.
 *
 * WHY THE STATUS TABLE LIVES IN THE APP AND NOT IN `httpeers.core`. Same
 * split the core already uses for `allowForward` (supplied by the caller,
 * never decided in the router): a status code is policy. `errors.ts`
 * anticipated this crossing -- `kind` exists, in its own words, "so a
 * caller can `switch` on it, or forward it across a boundary that cannot
 * carry a class reference" -- but anticipating the crossing is not owning
 * the status choice.
 *
 * 4. MAKE SURE A ROUTE TO THE TARGET PEER EXISTS FIRST (Task 15). Added
 *    after the Playwright suite found that this had NEVER worked: a page
 *    calling ANOTHER PAGE got `peer-unreachable`, every time, while a Node
 *    peer calling that same browser provider over the same relay got a 200.
 *    The cause is not in the provider and not in the transport --
 *    `httpeers.core`'s `remote()` dials by PEER ID, which resolves through
 *    libp2p's peerStore, and a browser peer's peerStore entry for another
 *    browser peer is either absent or a bare `/p2p-circuit` address that
 *    libp2p refuses to open `/httpeers/1.0.0` over. Something has to dial
 *    `<relay>/p2p-circuit/webrtc/p2p/<peer>` explicitly, exactly as
 *    `peer-runtime.ts` already does for the HUB at startup, and the page
 *    cannot be the thing that does it without becoming the SDK this module
 *    exists to prevent. So the edge does it, through the `ensureRoute` hook
 *    below -- a callback, so this module stays libp2p-free and testable
 *    under plain Node (see the note above).
 *
 *    IT NEVER FAILS THE CALL ITSELF. A dial that throws is swallowed and
 *    `dispatch` is attempted anyway: the call that follows produces T-2's
 *    own typed `PeerCallError` -- with the right `kind` for the page to
 *    render -- whereas a rethrow here would surface as an untyped 500 from
 *    `SwHttpDispatcher`'s catch and lose exactly the distinction job 3
 *    exists to preserve.
 *
 * INBOUND REQUESTS ARE NOT TOUCHED AT ALL. The same `dispatch` also serves
 * traffic that arrived from OTHER peers over libp2p, and that traffic must
 * never be handed our token: doing so would let any peer that can reach us
 * borrow our membership for a call to a third party. The discriminant is
 * `lookupPeer(req) === undefined` -- the very same one `createPeer`'s own
 * `allowForward` uses (`peer.ts`) to tell "originated at our own edge" from
 * "arrived from the network", because libp2p's handshake always proves
 * someone for the latter. An inbound request is passed to `dispatch`
 * BYTE-IDENTICAL, with no prefix strip, no header, and no error mapping, so
 * this module cannot change how this peer behaves as a server at all.
