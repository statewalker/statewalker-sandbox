/**
 * This origin's persistent libp2p identity, in IndexedDB.
 *
 * IDENTITY PERSISTS PER ORIGIN. Each page (the main app, the image peer,
 * the hub page) is its own origin (`../static-server/main.ts`'s "ORIGINS
 * ARE A CORRECTNESS REQUIREMENT" note) and therefore its own IndexedDB, so
 * each gets its OWN signing key and its own peerId. That is deliberate: two
 * pages sharing one identity would be two independent libp2p nodes racing
 * to be "the" peer for that identity, which is a different and worse
 * problem than two distinct mesh members.
 *
 * THE KEY FORMAT IS THE NODE SIDE'S, EXACTLY. `@libp2p/crypto/keys`'s
 * protobuf encoding -- the same bytes `../setup/keys.ts` writes to
 * `.httpeers/hub.key` and `../hub/main.ts` reads back -- just stored in
 * IndexedDB instead of a file, because a browser has no filesystem to write
 * one to. That is not a cosmetic alignment: `peerIdFromPrivateKey` on a key
 * that round-tripped through this store must produce the SAME peerId string
 * as the Node path produces for the same key, or the hub page's mesh
 * identity would not be the thing every token's `mesh` claim restates.
 * `tests/browser-identity.test.ts` pins that round trip.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SPLIT OUT OF `./node-profile.ts` (Task 24). That module
 * loaded the key and handed it straight to `createLibp2p`, which never
 * gives it back -- fine for a page that only needs a node, and impossible
 * for the hub page, which must ALSO pass the very same key to `createPeer`
 * so its `mintToken` closure signs as the mesh (`httpeers.core`'s
 * `CreatePeerInit.privateKey`). Loading the identity is now its own step
 * that a caller can take first and use twice. `node-profile.ts` re-exports
 * everything here, so nothing that imported it from there had to change.
