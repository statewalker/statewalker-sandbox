/**
 * The ServiceWorker edge: mounts a peer's `dispatch` into
 * `@statewalker/webrun-http-browser`'s `SwHttpAdapter` so a page's own
 * `fetch()` (same-origin) can reach it, no different in shape from any
 * other HTTP request on the page.
 *
 * `dispatch` MOUNTS UNCHANGED -- NO WRAPPER, NO CAST (design note 22 §1,
 * criterion 1 of prototype E-1). `httpeers.core`'s `FetchHandler` is
 * `(Request) => Promise<Response>`; `SwHttpAdapter.register`'s `HttpHandler`
 * (`@statewalker/webrun-http-streams`) is `(Request) => Response |
 * Promise<Response>` -- the same contract, arrived at independently, which
 * is exactly why `mountEdge` below passes `dispatch` straight through with
 * no adapter of its own.
 *
 * THE KEY/PREFIX TRAP -- see `edge-guard.ts`'s `assertKeyMatchesPrefix` for
 * the mechanism and why it is factored into its own file.
 *
 * WORKSPACE IMPORT, NOT NPM (design note 39 "Published 0.3.3 and workspace
 * 0.3.3 are different artefacts"). `SwHttpAdapter` does not exist in the
 * published npm tarball's dist bundle at all -- `src/sw/index.js` is
 * absent there, the re-export is commented out, and the deep import fails
 * `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`. `package.json` pins
 * `@statewalker/webrun-http-browser: workspace:*` for exactly this reason.
 * The WORKSPACE package's own `package.json` still points its `./sw`
 * export at `./dist/sw.js`, and that package ships no committed `dist/`
 * (gitignored, `workspaces/webrun-wire/.gitignore`) -- so this import only
 * resolves once `pnpm --filter @statewalker/webrun-http-browser build` (or
 * an equivalent `turbo build` that reaches it) has actually run. This is
 * the known defect the task brief calls out; see this task's report for
 * exactly what was verified and how.

 * exactly that filename with `Service-Worker-Allowed: /`) and by both vite
 * configs, which name the `sw` entry `sw.js` with no content hash for this
 * exact reason.
 *
 * SUPPLYING THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL, AND OMITTING IT IS NOT A GRACEFUL
 * DEGRADATION. `SwHttpAdapter`'s own defaults are mutually recursive:
 * `scope` reads `serviceWorkerUrl`, which (when unset) computes
 * `new URL("./index-sw.js", rootUrl)`, and `rootUrl` reads `scope` again
 * (`sw-dispatcher.ts`'s three getters). With neither `scope` nor
 * `serviceWorkerUrl` given, the CONSTRUCTOR -- which validates `this.scope`
 * -- recurses until the stack is exhausted. Verified directly by
 * constructing one under Node: `RangeError: Maximum call stack size
 * exceeded`, before `start()` is ever reached. `mountEdge` previously
 * forwarded `init.serviceWorkerUrl` straight through, so every caller that
 * left it unset (the image peer page, Task 12) would have hit that
 * RangeError the first time it ran in a real browser. Defaulting here fixes
 * every such caller at once rather than asking each page to remember.
