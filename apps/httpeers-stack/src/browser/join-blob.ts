/**
 * The join blob: everything a page needs to join a mesh whose hub is
 * ANOTHER BROWSER PAGE, in one copyable string.
 *
 * WHY IT HAS TO EXIST. Every page in this stack has so far learned the mesh
 * from `httpeers.json` -- `{ relayAddrs: [{ addr, subnetwork }], hubPeerId }`, written once by
 * `pnpm bootstrap` (`../setup/main.ts`) and served by both origins. That
 * works because the Node hub's identity comes from a key file generated at
 * bootstrap, so its peerId is knowable BEFORE it runs. The hub page's is
 * not: it generates (or reloads) its identity in IndexedDB, in a tab, after
 * `pnpm bootstrap` has already been and gone. Nothing on disk can name it.
 * So the hub page hands its peerId out at runtime, alongside the relay it
 * reserved through and a single-use invitation id -- and this module is the
 * shape of that hand-off.
 *
 * ONE INVITATION PER PAGE, NOT ONE PER MESH. Invitations are single-use by
 * construction (`../hub/hub-state.ts`'s `redeem` moves the id to
 * `spentInvitationIds`, and the spent check runs first, unconditionally), so
 * a blob shared between two pages lets exactly one in and fails the other
 * with `already-redeemed`. `../pages/hub/main.ts` mints a fresh invitation
 * per blob for that reason; this module only carries what it is given.
 *
 * THE ENCODING IS BASE64URL OF JSON, and it is a URL query parameter
 * (`?join=`). Two properties matter and nothing else does: it survives a
 * copy-paste through a terminal, a chat window and a browser address bar
 * without needing quoting (base64url's alphabet is `A-Za-z0-9-_`, all
 * URL-safe and none of it shell-special), and it is one token, so an
 * operator cannot paste half of it. It is NOT encryption and not
 * authentication -- anyone holding the blob can redeem the invitation
 * inside it, which is exactly what an invitation is.
 *
 * NOT A HEADER, EVER. Same rule the rest of this app follows: human-facing
 * text travels in a body or a URL, never a header (HTTP header values are
 * latin1 -- see `../services/search.ts`'s own note).
 */

 * The invitation payload's shape (`../setup/main.ts`'s `HttpeersConfig`) plus
 * the one-shot invitation id that goes with it.
 *
 * `relayAddrs` CARRIES THE SUBNETWORK NAME, and it has to: a page handed only
 * an address cannot announce, cannot reserve, and cannot reach the hub that
 * invited it. The name travels here in the open, which is fine and is the
 * point -- it is not a key, a secret or a credential, and a blob is copied
 * into a chat window by design.
