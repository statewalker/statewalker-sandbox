 * libp2p; it is handed a `mintToken` capability already scoped to this
 * peer's own signing key (see `createPeer`'s `mounts` factory in
 * `@statewalker/httpeers.core`), never the key itself.
 *
 * Built on Hono. `app.fetch` is already `(Request) => Promise<Response>`, so
 * it drops straight into the `FetchHandler` contract with no adapter — and
 * `c.req.raw` is the very `Request` the transport (or, in a test, the
 * caller) registered a peer binding on, which is what makes `lookupPeer`
 * and `lookupClaims` work at all from inside a handler.
 *
 * NO QUERY PARAMETERS. Conditional reads use `ETag` / `If-None-Match`, not
 * `?since=`: some transports drop `url.search` before the wire, and ETag is
 * better HTTP regardless.
