/**
 * The mesh view: a PROJECTION over the three registries (members, presence,
 * advertisements), not a fourth registry of its own. Nothing here is stored
 * — it is recomputed from the hub's live state on every read, filtered by
 * whoever is asking.
 *
 * THE HUB IS A BULLETIN BOARD, NEVER AN AUTHORITY. An advertisement says
 * "worth asking"; the provider it names still decides for itself whether to
 * answer. Nothing downstream may treat inclusion in this view as a grant —
 * that is what the membership token and each provider's own `.access` tree
 * are for.
 *
 * Two things vary by caller, both because different callers legitimately
 * see different views:
 *  - a member with role `hidden` is omitted from the view of anyone who does
 *    not themselves hold `std:mesh.admin` — this is the one consumer of the
 *    `hidden` role `DEFAULT_VOCABULARY` already declares;
 *  - an advertisement is omitted unless the caller holds the capability that
 *    gates its `kind` (`advertisementAccess`, hub-owned config — analogous
 *    to an `.access` entry, but for the bulletin board rather than a path).
