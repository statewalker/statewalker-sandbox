/**
 * `GET /images` / `GET /images/{id}` — the image peer's own service (Task
 * 12, design record §5.5): "a provider running in a browser," the thing
 * nothing in this record has done yet. This module is the pure, isomorphic
 * half of it — no `node:fs`, no browser API, no libp2p — so it typechecks
 * and unit-tests under plain Node exactly like `search.ts` does; only the
 * PAGE (`../pages/image-peer/main.ts`) and the test fixture loader
 * (`image-fixtures.node.ts`) know how bytes actually get onto disk or into
 * a bundle.
 *
 * THE SEAM: `ImagesEndpointInit.files` is a bare `FilesApi`
 * (`@statewalker/webrun-files`) — this module never imports
 * `@statewalker/webrun-files-mem` or any other concrete implementation, so
 * swapping the in-memory fixture store for OPFS or a real file picker later
 * is a change to what gets passed as `files`, never to `createImagesEndpoint`
 * or to `IMAGES_ACCESS_TREE`.
 *
 * TITLES GO IN THE JSON LIST, NEVER IN A HEADER. Same reasoning as
 * `search.ts`'s own module comment: HTTP header values are latin1 by
 * specification, so a title carrying an accented letter or an emoji (the
 * fixture set carries both, deliberately — see `image-fixtures/manifest.json`)
 * would throw or be mangled before the request ever reached the wire if it
 * were hoisted into a header. `GET /images` returns titles in the body;
 * `GET /images/{id}` returns ONLY bytes and a `content-type`, no title at
 * all — there was never a reason to put one there.
 *
 * STREAMING IS NOT `files.read()`'S DEFAULT SHAPE — IT IS THIS HANDLER'S
 * JOB. `MemFilesApi.read(path)` with no `{ length }` yields the WHOLE file
 * as a single `Uint8Array` in one iteration; calling it that way and handing
 * the result to `new Response(...)` would "work" (correct bytes, wrong
 * property) while defeating the one thing this page exists to demonstrate
 * (browser-to-browser response streaming over WebRTC — design note 20, "4
 * chunks sent, 4 chunks received"). `createImagesEndpoint`'s `GET
 * /images/:id` handler instead drives a `ReadableStream` whose `pull`
 * repeatedly calls `files.read(path, { start, length: chunkSize })` —
 * `MemFilesApi.read` honours `start`/`length` and yields at most one
 * bounded chunk per call (verified by reading `mem-files-api.ts` directly),
 * so this handler alone controls how many chunks a client observes,
 * regardless of what the underlying `FilesApi` implementation would have
 * handed back for an unbounded read.

/**
 * This provider's OWN `.access` tree -- design record §5.5's "it runs its
 * own `.access` -- the provider decides who may read, the hub only
 * advertises," made concrete. Gates every route `createImagesEndpoint`
 * serves behind `app:images.read` (declared in `../policy.ts`'s
 * `VOCABULARY`, already granted to `member`); denies everything else
 * (`"/"`: `anyOf: []`) -- exactly the brief's own two-line snippet, no more.
 *
 * WHY THIS WORKS AS ONE ENTRY, NOT ONE PER IMAGE. An earlier version of this
 * tree (pre-review) declared one exact leaf per fixture id
 * (`/images/relay-node`, `/images/mesh-diagram`, …) alongside `/images`,
 * because `httpeers.core`'s `resolveAccess` used to treat `/images` (no
 * trailing slash) as an EXACT-ONLY match with no way to also govern
 * `/images/{id}`. That was a real gap -- verified directly against the
 * library before writing this file at all, see this app's `PROVENANCE.md`
 * (Task 12) for the reproduction -- but the right fix was in the library,
 * not a per-catalogue workaround here: a workaround that enumerates every
 * id it grants cannot generalize to a provider whose sub-resources are not
 * known ahead of time. Fixed in `httpeers.core`'s `resolveAccess` (a key now
 * governs its own path AND its subtree, so `/images` alone grants both `GET
 * /images` and `GET /images/{id}` at any depth -- see that package's own
 * `PROVENANCE.md`, "Task 12 (review)"). This tree is the simplification that
 * fix makes possible: exactly what the brief specified, verified against
 * the fixed library by `tests/images.test.ts`, not merely trusted.
