/**
 * 08 — the mesh as ordinary HTTP.
 *
 * ONE `FetchHandler` that serves every resource in the mesh at
 * `/{peerId}/{servicePath}`, so whatever mounts it — `@hono/node-server`, a
 * ServiceWorker, a relay — never learns that libp2p exists.
 *
 * BUILT ON THE PROVEN EDGE, NOT BESIDE IT. The dispatch a page already uses
 * (`src/browser/edge-dispatch.ts`) does four things that took four separate
 * bugs to discover: strip the mount prefix, attach the membership token at
 * call time, ensure a route before the call rides it, and map a thrown
 * `PeerCallError` onto a status the caller can read. This file does not
 * reimplement any of them — it rewrites the request and hands it to that
 * handler, which is what `MemberHandle.fetch` exposes.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEW HERE, and the only thing that is:
 *
 *   1. `basePath` is a parameter. The ServiceWorker edge is keyed to
 *      `/{key}/` and cannot mount at `/`; a Node server mounts wherever it
 *      likes, including `/`. One handler, three hosts.
 *   2. A listing at `GET {basePath}/`, which enumerates peers and the KINDS
 *      they advertise — never URLs. The mesh view carries no service paths,
 *      so a listing that promised URLs would be inventing them.
 *   3. Dispatch is read per request from the live mesh view, so a peer that
 *      joins after the server started is reachable with no rebuild.
