/**
 * The two containment candidates, as code, so the decision can be measured.
 *
 * Rung 06 found the hole and refused to choose a remedy: a root-absolute URL
 * from inside a rendered host page — `/static/app.css` — resolves against the
 * VIEWER's origin, silently, and `<base href>` does not fix it because it
 * governs relative URLs only.
 *
 * Three candidates were named. One ("host apps must use relative URLs only")
 * is not a mechanism — nothing enforces it — so it is not implemented here.
 * The other two are, and the point of the rung is that they are measured
 * against the SAME escape:
 *
 *   A. A path-scoped Content-Security-Policy on the ghost's own responses.
 *   B. A sandboxed iframe with no `allow-same-origin`, giving the document an
 *      opaque origin so the viewer's origin is cross-origin to it.
 *
 * Both are applied by the GHOST, to responses the ghost already controls. That
 * is what makes them viable at all: neither needs cooperation from the host
 * app, and neither needs DNS or TLS, which is what sank the subdomain option.
