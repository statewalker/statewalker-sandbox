/**
 * `startMember` — the candidate `member` package's entry point.
 *
 * THIS IS `src/browser/peer-runtime.ts`'s `startBrowserPeer` WITH THREE
 * COUPLINGS LIFTED OUT, and nothing else changed. Every step of the join is
 * the proven one, imported from the stack rather than reimplemented:
 * `dialRelay`, `reachHub`, `createPeer`, `resumeMembership`,
 * `redeemInvitation`, `reserveOnHub`, `superviseHubReservation`,
 * `leaveRelay`, `startJoin`, `createRouteEnsurer`, `createEdgeDispatch`.
 * If this file had to re-implement any of them, the seam would be in the
 * wrong place and the rung would have failed.
 *
 * The three couplings, and why each is a platform boundary rather than a
 * preference:
 *
 *   1. `createNode` — `createBrowserNode` hard-codes the browser transport
 *      set (webSockets + webRTC + circuitRelay) and reads the identity key
 *      out of IndexedDB. Node needs `tcp` as well, and its key comes from a
 *      file. The LISTEN ADDRESSES ARE NOT A PLATFORM CHOICE and are kept
 *      identical: a member listens on `/p2p-circuit` + `/webrtc` because it
 *      reserves on its hub, which is what `feat/hub-relay` established.
 *   2. `mountEdge` — the ServiceWorker is how a *page* turns `fetch()` into
 *      a mesh call. Node has no ServiceWorker and needs none: the dispatch
 *      handler IS the edge, callable in process. So the edge is optional,
 *      and `MemberHandle.fetch` is always present — on both platforms it is
 *      the same `createEdgeDispatch` handler, which is the whole isomorphism
 *      claim in one field.
 *   3. `watchWake` — `page-wake.ts` listens on `window`/`document`. A Node
 *      process has no such events; the supervisor's own backstop timer is
 *      what covers it, so the default is a no-op rather than a stub.
 *
 * `rules` replaces `policies`: `peer-runtime.ts` calls the app's `appRules`,
 * which bakes `APP_RULES` — an application's vocabulary — into what ought to
 * be library code. The caller passes a built `RuleSet` instead.
