/**
 * The NODE half of `MemberPlatform` — the counterpart to
 * `src/browser/node-profile.ts`'s `createBrowserNode`.
 *
 * WHAT DIFFERS FROM THE BROWSER PROFILE, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT:
 *
 *   - `tcp()` is added. It is the one transport a page cannot have and the
 *     one a Node member wants, for the direct member-to-member hop a page
 *     makes over WebRTC instead.
 *   - The LISTEN ADDRESSES ARE THE SAME — `/p2p-circuit` and `/webrtc`,
 *     plus a loopback TCP port. If a Node member listened differently it
 *     would reserve somewhere else, and the rung would be testing a
 *     different design rather than the same one on another platform.
 *   - The connection gater is permissive, which the browser profile also
 *     does for loopback and private addresses (`dialNeedsPermissiveGater`).
 *     Node has no browser default to relax, so this is the same policy
 *     arrived at from the other side.
 *   - There is no `mountEdge`: `MemberHandle.fetch` is the edge under Node.
 *   - There is no `watchWake`: a Node process gets no wake events, so the
 *     supervisor's backstop timer is the whole story.
