/**
 * The candidate `ghost` package's core: a forwarder PINNED to one peer.
 *
 * WHAT THE GHOST IS. From the 2026-08-22 notes: not an application, but "the
 * mechanism by which an application hosted by one peer is launched from
 * another" — an invitation, one mount, one reachable peer. The host serves
 * HTML, assets and endpoints under its own peerId; the viewer renders them;
 * no source code travels.
 *
 * WHY A PIN IS NEEDED AT ALL, AND WHAT IS WRONG WITHOUT ONE. The stack's
 * `createEdgeDispatch` reads the target peer out of the FIRST PATH SEGMENT
 * and attaches the viewer's own membership token to whatever it forwards. A
 * page rendered through it can therefore address ANY peer in the mesh, with
 * the viewer's credentials, simply by fetching a different first segment.
 * That is correct for the viewer's own app and wrong for a foreign one: a
 * ghost renders someone else's HTML, and that HTML must not be able to walk
 * the mesh on the viewer's behalf.
 *
 * The pin is therefore not a convenience wrapper over edge-dispatch — it is a
 * DIFFERENT handler that never reads a peer id from the request at all. The
 * peer is supplied once, at mount time, and the path is data.
