/**
 * The HOST peer's app, as a plain handler.
 *
 * Standing in for a remote peer's mounted site: it serves an HTML page, a
 * relative asset and an endpoint. The transport is not under test here — rung
 * 01 already carries a real mesh call — so this is invoked directly by the
 * ghost's `remote`, which is exactly the seam a real deployment fills with
 * `peer.dispatch`.
 *
 * The page it serves deliberately fetches THREE ways, because the difference
 * between them is what this rung measures:
 *   - `asset.txt`      — relative, resolves inside the ghost's mount
 *   - `/static/escape.txt` — root-absolute, resolves against the VIEWER's origin
 *   - `/ghost/<other peer>/x` — an attempt to walk the mesh
