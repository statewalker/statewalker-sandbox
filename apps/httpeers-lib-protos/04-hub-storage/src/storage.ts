/**
 * The candidate `hub` package's storage seam, and two adapters for it.
 *
 * DERIVED, NOT DESIGNED. Everything the hub does to storage today is
 * whole-value get / set / delete by key: `persist.ts` reads and writes one
 * JSON file; `browser/snapshot-store.ts` reads and writes one IndexedDB
 * value. Nothing lists, appends, or compare-and-sets. So the interface is
 * those three methods and no more.
 *
 * `SnapshotStore` (`hub/hub-state.ts`) is deliberately SYNCHRONOUS, because
 * every mutation writes and returns, and an async write would let a caller be
 * told "member added" while the snapshot still said otherwise. Both async
 * backends therefore need the same wrapper the browser already has: the
 * in-memory copy is authoritative, and flushes are serialised behind it.
 * `asyncSnapshotStore` below is that wrapper, generalised — it is
 * `browser/snapshot-store.ts`'s logic over any `KeyValueStorage` rather than
 * over idb-keyval specifically.
